go-nakadi
=========

Is a client for the [Nakadi](https://zalando.github.io/nakadi/manual.html) event broker written in and 
for Go. the package provides convenient access to many features of Nakadi's API. 

The package can be used to manage event type definitions. The EventAPI can be used to inspect existing 
event types and allows further to create new event types and to update existing ones. The SubscriptionAPI 
provides subscription management: existing subscriptions can be fetched from Nakadi and of course it is 
also possible to create new ones. The PublishAPI of this library is used to broadcast event types of 
all event type categories via Nakadi. Last but not least, the package also implements a StreamAPI, which 
enables event processing on top of Nakadi's subscription based high level API.

To make the communication with Nakadi more resilient all sub APIs of this package can be configured
to retry failed requests using an exponential back-off algorithm. Please consult the 
[package documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/stoewer/go-nakadi) for further details.

Versions and stability
