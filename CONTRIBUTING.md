Contribute code
---------------

If you would like to contribute code and/or documentation directly, you are very welcome to open a pull
request with your contributions.

The following steps outline the workflow for code contributions:

* All pull request should be linked to an existing issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/stoewer/go-nakadi/issues). 
  Before you star to work on your code, please assign an existing issue to your account. Or create a new
  one that you would like to work on.
* Fork the repository.
* Write your code and commit the changes to your fork.
* Open a new pull request. The pull request description should contain a summary of the changes and a
  reference to the respective issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/stoewer/go-nakadi/issues).
* Your pull request will then be reviewed, and finally, if everything looks good, merged into master.

Code style
----------

The project adheres to common Go code style conventions. Code must be formatted with `gofmt` or a compatible 
tool, and must pass linting via `golint`. In doubt just read through the existing code base to figure out 
code and naming conventions used in this project.

**Happy hacking!**
